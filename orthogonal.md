# Orthogonality

In the previous sections we defined vectors, vector spaces and subspaces. We saw that we can add vectors and multiply then with scalars. The closure property guarantees that 
we end up with another vector in the same vector space. It is possible to find a set of vectors with which we can represent every vector in the vector
space by adding them together and scaling them.
