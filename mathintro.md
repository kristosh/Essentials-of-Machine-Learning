title: Introduction to Machine Learning.
description: In this page we will introduce the concept of Machine Learning and some pre-requisites. What is consider to be 'data', a dataset and a machine learning model? Moreover, we will introduce some basics from Linear algebra and Geometry that will be useful throughout this course.

## Introduction to Machine Learning

> Machine learning domain concerns the designing of algorithms that automatically extracts interesting information from knowledge sources that we call data. 

A definition of datum/data

Machine learning is data-driven and the data is at core of machine learning. The goals is to design general purposes methodologies with which we can extract interesting patterns and that are not dependent in expertise domain. For instance having a huge corpus of textual data from Wikipedia we can extract information about 

## Data and datasets

> Definition of what we consider as datum and data and how exactly we perceive them in Machine Learning

## Types of Data 

Data exists in different flavours. First and foremost could be numerical data: imagine for example the measurements of scientific tools. Scientific instruments used to quantify physical properties. These tools range from simple rulers and graduated cylinders to more advanced devices like micrometers, pH meters, and data loggers


## Data as vectors and matrices

## Linear Algebra

## Geometry
