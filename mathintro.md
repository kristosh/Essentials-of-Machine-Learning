## Introduction to Machine Learning

> Machine learning domain concerns the designing of algorithms that automatically extracts interesting information from knowledge sources that we call data. 

A definition of datum/data

Machine learning is data-driven and the data is at core of machine learning. The goals is to design general purposes methodologies with which we can extract interesting patterns and that are not dependent in expertise domain. For instance having a huge corpus of textual data from Wikipedia we can extract information about these wikipedia sites such as the topic of each page but also event analysis or sentiment analysis in reviews from webpages such as IMDB.

Give some examples here of that can work.

## Data and datasets

There are multiple definitions for the word `data`. We will try to make sense for this word by providing several definitions for this word:

> Data refers to recorded observations or measurable pieces of information, often collected from experiments, transactions, sensors, texts, or user behavior, that are used to represent phenomena, derive insights, or inform decision-making through analysis.

> Data are values or observations, usually structured, often numeric, that represent attributes of entities and are used to answer questions.

> Data are representations of variables measured from the real world, which can be used to model and infer patterns or causality.


So central to the concept of data is the numerical or not representation of information about the real world and under a study domain that can be found or produced in the real world or online. That involves information that we exchange or measurements from scientific studies that are captured structured and presented in a formatted way.


## Types of Data 

Data exists in different flavours. First and foremost could be numerical data: imagine for example the measurements of scientific tools. Scientific instruments used to quantify physical properties. These tools range from simple rulers and graduated cylinders to more advanced devices like micrometers, pH meters, and data loggers


## Data as vectors and matrices

While as we just mentioned not all data is numerical, for a computer perspective, it is always necessary to transform these data into a numerical format. Thus, when we talk about images we talk about pixel-values, and when we talk about text we are talking about string and numerical representation of these strings.

## Linear Algebra

## Geometry
