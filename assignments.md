## Welcome to another page

There will be in total three assignments for the course. The format of these assignments are 3 jupyter notebook with blocks of codes that you can run and with missing code, but also eventually some tasks that needs to be done and you will need to submit an individual report for each one of these assignments. These assignments needs to be submitted via Brightspace. You can find the link in here. The deadlines will be announced soon.

The topic of the assignments are the following:


1. Loading datasets and data processing. Running a couple of methods for classification, regression and unsupervised learning
   1. data processing and analysis
   2. data visualization
   3. training classifiers/regressors
   4. finding interesting patterns in data
   5. evaluate the performance of your models
2. Neural networks, Ensemble methods and transfer learning (training and evaluation)
   1. data processing and analysis, visualization
   2. design a Neural network and check all the necessary steps (loss functions, optimization and training)
   3. Simple examples of transfer learning
   3. evaluation of the model
   4. Visualization of the results
3. Explainability and bias in data (AI alignment?)
   1. LIME algorithm
   2. Code on Bias and textual data
   3. Maybe some info on AI and alignment

The data that we will use in these assignments are a various of standard datasets like: MNIST, Iris Dataset, Boston Housing Dataset etc.
